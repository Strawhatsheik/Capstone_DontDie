# Capstone_DontDie
 A repository for DontDie, a Java game developed in Netbeans
Don't Die! was the program I designed as my graduating project for my Associates of Computer Programming and was finished in July of 2017. To see screenshots and video, check it out on my Behance: https://www.behance.net/gallery/129133979/Dont-Die ! 

I developed and programed it in Java using the NetBeans IDE. My original idea was a ‘choose your own adventure’ type game. Players would read through the story and, depending on their choices, the game would advance. This was before I understood how much game development was a team endeavor! To make this seemingly simple idea a reality took much more coordination than I anticipated.

While it was not the only time I was to be a member of a game development team during my education, it was the first time I’d be in the role of leader. It started with me approaching my sister, who is a writer and English major, for edits and support with my story line. I then enlisted my elder sister, who is an artist, with my picture ideas. As the project continued to grow, I added a third sister who helped with art and writing as well. As the game evolved I decided on two difficulty settings and therefore two different stories. There was an illustration for each scene (level) and its consequences, and a background gameboard where the character’s avatar moved from level to level while changing appearance based on what happened in the story.

I learned a lot in this process, not just in programming and design but also about communication while developing a game with a team. Being family I thought we were communicating well, but sometimes specifics can be lost. For instance, I told both my sisters, the writer and main artist, the same plot idea: a story where the user is abducted by aliens and has to escape. The game would be titled Don’t Die! because the goal was to escape alive. Various things could happen to the player’s character along the adventure, such as losing an eye, breaking an arm, etc., based on the user’s choice. They both delivered; however the writer gave me an epic, and rather dark, alien escape tale, while the artist brought me back hilarious stick figure art for each scene. One was aiming for a college classroom audience and the other a family friendly experience based on humor and silly illustrations. Also, the space-odyssey storyline provided far more choices than anticipated, leading to much more coding than I originally planned.

In the end the game came together wonderfully, with a jungle exploration adventure added (and a pirate adventure still in the works!). My roles and responsibilities were numerous as I was the main designer, programmer, and the project lead. I coordinated all our efforts, set deadlines, and accepted or asked for redoes on work. The project was more extensive than anticipated but the final result was something we were all proud of, a delightfully macabre and humorous game.​​​​​​ Something I particularly love about this game is that we were able to inject humor and puns into even the death of the player. The game is fun no matter what happens.​​​​​​​
